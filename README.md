Godot Ping Pong game
This game was made as part of a Udemy course. The course was fairly old and some of the information was outdated and required me to read the Godot documentation
to get by. The course is where the resourses such as the images used. I used this game as a starting point for making GUI games and read that Godot is a good 
language to start with.
